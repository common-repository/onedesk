This plugin allows you to seamlessly add the OneDesk widget to your website and customize it to fit your website aesthetic in order to enhance the overall customer experience on your site.

== Description ==
OneDesk provides your business with three customer-facing apps that you can put on your website to start interacting with your customers and website visitors. This process is now made even simpler with the creation of this plugin. Simply follow the installation steps and provide your customers with quick access to the OneDesk widget that houses the following features:

1 - The *Messenger* tab application allows you to chat with your customers in real time. These chats can then be captured as tickets.

2 - The *Portal* tab provides an interface for your customers to track their tickets with you. Once here, they can update themselves on the status, as well as engage with the agents responsible for their ticket. 

3 - The *New* tab provides a form for your customer to submit new tickets.

Through this plugin, access to your OneDesk customer apps can now be incorporated into your website in just a couple of clicks!
